Latex Templates for Discrete Math, MATH 3336 at University of Houston. I recommend using https://www.swiftlatex.com/ ... or viewing this at https://www.overleaf.com/read/vzjvddhwcgrr 

This is a LaTeX template that conforms to the standards required by Dr. Irina Perepelitsa at the University of Houston for MATH 3336 - Discrete Math. I created it entirely from scratch, and designed it specifically to be easy to use by other students. 

Towards the goal of ease-of-use for students who have never used TeX before, I've trivially and superficially remapped typical [`\section`, `\subsection`, and `\subsubsection`] to [`\problemnumer`, `\question`, and `\answer`]. However, the custom functionality in `\explanation` is necessary and sufficient for aesthetically aligned text blocks. Making this allowed me to answer a question I had that I found someone else had asked back in 2018 with no answers: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/447134/adjustwidth-of-all-sections/561837#561837

There are lots of improvements I'd like to make still. Against best practice, all the code is one file for copy-paste portability, which I feel is important for students to have.

The PDF included here is an example of the output. It demonstrates output of:

The overall layout is mapped to its constituent functions below. It is designed to conform to the professor's requirements for homework in this course.
